Building your Recurrent Neural Network - Step by Step
  Welcome to Course 5's first assignment, where you'll be implementing key components of a Recurrent Neural Network, or RNN, in NumPy!
  By the end of this assignment, you'll be able to:
     Define notation for building sequence models
     Describe the architecture of a basic RNN
     Identify the main components of an LSTM
     Implement backpropagation through time for a basic RNN and an LSTM
     Give examples of several types of RNN

Character level language model - Dinosaurus Island
  Welcome to Dinosaurus Island! 65 million years ago, dinosaurs existed, and in this assignment, they have returned.
  You are in charge of a special task: Leading biology researchers are creating new breeds of dinosaurs and bringing them to life on earth, and your job is to give names   to these dinosaurs. If a dinosaur does not like its name, it might go berserk, so choose wisely!
  Luckily you're equipped with some deep learning now, and you will use it to save the day! Your assistant has collected a list of all the dinosaur names they could       find, and compiled them into this dataset. (Feel free to take a look by clicking the previous link.) To create new dinosaur names, you will build a character-level       language model to generate new names. Your algorithm will learn the different name patterns, and randomly generate new names. Hopefully this algorithm will keep you     and your team safe from the dinosaurs' wrath!

  By the time you complete this assignment, you'll be able to:

    Store text data for processing using an RNN
    Build a character-level text generation model using an RNN
    Sample novel sequences in an RNN
    Explain the vanishing/exploding gradient problem in RNNs
    Apply gradient clipping as a solution for exploding gradients

Improvise a Jazz Solo with an LSTM Network
  Welcome to your final programming assignment of this week! In this notebook, you will implement a model that uses an LSTM to generate music. At the end, you'll even be   able to listen to your own music!
  By the end of this assignment, you'll be able to:

    Apply an LSTM to a music generation task
    Generate your own jazz music with deep learning
    Use the flexible Functional API to create complex models
